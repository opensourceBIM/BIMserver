BDB JE HA support for applications that need to track the composition of a
replication group, in order to do tasks such as load balancing and
request routing.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
The Monitor is intended for applications that do not directly
reference ReplicatedEnvironment, but need to track the composition of
a replication group and the current Master. A Monitor tracks changes
in replication group membership and roles.
