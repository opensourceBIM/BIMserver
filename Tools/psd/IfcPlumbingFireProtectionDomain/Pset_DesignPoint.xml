<PropertySetDef><IfcVersion version="2x3 TC1" schema="IFCSHAREDBLDGSERVICEELEMENTS"/><Name>Pset_DesignPoint</Name><Definition>Definition from IAI:  A point of connection taken as a reference for hydraulic calculations in sprinkler systems. The point is assigned to an instance of IfcDistributionPort and located according to circumstances as set out by local building codes. For instance, it may be either the last elbow, tee or branch downstream of which a sprinkler array is located (where ranges are directly connected to the distribution pipe without risers or drops) or the point of connection of the riser or drop nearest the installation valves in the sprinkler array (where ranges are connected to the distribution pipe with risers or drops). Other circumstances may be referenced in local codes and the assignment of the design point must be established by a user.
